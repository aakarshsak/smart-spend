Functional Requirements Documentation
1. User Management
   User Registration:
   – Users can create an account by providing basic details (name, email, password).
   – Email verification is required to activate the account.
   – Support for social logins (optional for future enhancement).

Authentication & Authorization:
– Secure login using email and password with JWT-based session management.
– Role-based access control (e.g., regular user vs. admin) to restrict access to certain endpoints.
– Password recovery via email.

Profile Management:
– Users can update profile details (name, contact information, etc.).
– Ability to change password after authentication.

Session Management:
– Session expiration and refresh token support for continuous authentication.
– Logout endpoint to invalidate JWT tokens.

2. Expense CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   Expense Entry:
   – Create: Users can add a new expense with fields such as:

Date: The date of the expense.
Amount: Numeric value, with currency support.
Category: Pre-defined (e.g., Food, Travel, Utilities) with possibility for custom categories.
Description: Brief text to describe the expense.
Attachment: Optionally attach a receipt image or document. – Validation: Ensure that required fields are provided and numeric values are within acceptable ranges.
Expense Retrieval:
– Read: Users can view a list of expenses in a paginated or filtered view.
– Filtering/Sorting: Allow filtering by date range, category, or amount; sorting by date or amount.

Expense Modification:
– Update: Users can edit an existing expense entry to correct or update information.
– Versioning/History: Optionally track changes for audit purposes.

Expense Deletion:
– Delete: Users can delete expense entries.
– Confirmation: Prompt for confirmation before deletion to prevent accidental data loss.

Bulk Operations:
– Support for bulk import/export (e.g., CSV upload/download) to ease data management.

3. Receipt Processing
   Receipt Upload:
   – Allow users to upload receipt images as part of the expense entry process.
   – Store receipt images in AWS S3 (or a similar storage service).

OCR Integration:
– Trigger: Automatically trigger an AWS Lambda function when a new receipt is uploaded.
– Processing: Use OCR (e.g., AWS Textract) to extract relevant details from the receipt, such as:

Date of purchase
Amount
Vendor name
Tax details (if applicable) – Data Validation: Validate extracted data (e.g., numeric conversion, date formatting) before integrating with expense records.
Error Handling:
– Provide fallback or manual correction options if OCR fails to extract accurate data.

Audit Trail:
– Log the OCR processing events and results for debugging and future improvement.

4. Analytics & Reporting
   Dashboard Overview:
   – Provide a summary view with key metrics such as total expenses, total income, and balance. – Display charts/graphs showing trends over time (e.g., monthly spending, category breakdown).

Detailed Reports:
– Generate detailed expense reports that allow users to drill down into data by:

Date ranges (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly)
Expense categories
Custom filters (e.g., high-value expenses)
Export Functionality:
– Allow users to export reports in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF) for offline analysis.

Data Aggregation:
– Periodically transfer transactional data from MySQL to BigQuery (or an analytics data warehouse) to perform complex queries without affecting operational performance.

Real-Time Updates:
– Ensure the analytics dashboard reflects the most current data, with periodic refreshing or via a push mechanism.

User Alerts & Notifications:
– Optionally provide notifications (email or in-app) if spending exceeds set budgets or if unusual spending patterns are detected.

This document captures the core user-facing functionalities and outlines key backend processes. Each requirement should be further refined with acceptance criteria and prioritized during development. This detailed breakdown will guide the development team and provide a comprehensive reference during design, coding, testing, and deployment phases.
